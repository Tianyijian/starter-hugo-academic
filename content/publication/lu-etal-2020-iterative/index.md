abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has received much attention recently
  in the natural language processing community. Considering that the emotions of the
  utterances in conversations are interactive, previous works usually implicitly model
  the emotion interaction between utterances by modeling dialogue context, but the
  misleading emotion information from context often interferes with the emotion interaction.
  We noticed that the gold emotion labels of the context utterances can provide explicit
  and accurate emotion interaction, but it is impossible to input gold labels at inference
  time. To address this problem, we propose an iterative emotion interaction network,
  which uses iteratively predicted emotion labels instead of gold emotion labels to
  explicitly model the emotion interaction. This approach solves the above problem,
  and can effectively retain the performance advantages of explicit modeling. We conduct
  experiments on two datasets, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.
