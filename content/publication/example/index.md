abstract: Obtaining affective response is a key step in building empathetic
  dialogue systems. This task has been studied a lot in generation-based
  chatbots, but the related research in retrieval-based chatbots is still in the
  early stage. Existing works in retrieval-based chatbots are based on
  Retrieve-and-Rerank framework, which have a common problem of satisfying
  affect label at the expense of response quality. To address this problem, we
  propose a simple and effective Retrieve-Discriminate-Rewrite framework. The
  framework replaces the reranking mechanism with a new discriminate-and-rewrite
  mechanism, which predicts the affect label of the retrieved high-quality
  response via discrimination module and further rewrites the affect unsatisfied
  response via rewriting module. This can not only guarantee the quality of the
  response, but also satisfy the given affect label. In addition, another
  challenge for this line of research is the lack of an off-the-shelf affective
  response dataset. To address this problem and test our proposed framework, we
  annotate a Sentimental Douban Conversation Corpus based on the original Douban
  Conversation Corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed framework is
  effective and outperforms competitive baselines.
